        <p>I'm a full-stack software developer. I've lived most of my life in Seattle, WA,
            and I'm proud to call it my home. I graduated from the University of Washington with a BS in
            Biochemistry with an intent on practicing medicine. After deciding to step away from health care for the
            time being, I began my journey in software development with Code Fellows. I'm excited to work toward
            landing a job with a
            company that develops software to improve people's lives and changes our world for the better. I'm eager
            to work on aspects of software that increase performance, improve memory allocation, and revolutionize
            the user experience.</p>

        <p> I'm a software developer with a background in music/education. Music software has become a valuable resource in music
            education, music production and countless of other areas . I would love to work in an area of coding that seeks to educate or entertain in some way and I believe my
            ability to inspire my students will help me become a valuable asset in this arena.</p>

        <h1>Laura Antonius</h1>
        <img src="images/Laurabiopic.jpg" alt="">
        <p>I'm a full-stack Javascript software developer. Like a lot of people in the field, I have a diverse background that brings unique strengths to the table. 
            From my experience as a professional musician, I've cultivated an exceptional attention to detail and a pretty robust work ethic, along with the confidence to speak comfortably in front of large groups.  My love of music corresponds strongly with my interest in being a developer, since there are a lot of similarities between the two fields: the need for independent practice and self-teaching, intense collaboration with colleagues, and a creative outlet to produce meaningful and beautiful things.
            Iâ€™m also drawing on my experience in healthcare and I would love to secure a developer role in a healthcare organization, and help produce software that streamlines the experience of healthcare consumers, to make their experiences seeking care as efficient and painless as possible.</p>

        <h1>Isaac Nelson</h1>
        <img src="images/isaacBioPic.jpg" alt="">
        <p>I am a fullstack web developer, a transitioning Marine Corps Veteran, and very soon to be a brand new father! In my past I found myself always wanting more out of my jobs, I remember my first squad leader telling me that I was always so reserved because the things we were doing were not intelectually engaging enough for me. I'll be honest I had no idea what he was talking about until I decided to give coding a try last summer. Now I understand, once I engaged in the level of mental exercise that programming takes, it felt like my mind was finally stretching it's legs! I love learning what it takes to create something new, for the first time in my life I feel real meaning in what I do, And I cant wait to do more! </p>
